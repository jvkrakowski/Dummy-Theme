# Dummy Theme for WordPress

Dummy is a WordPress theme created for the sole purpose of showcasing key developer skills. Feel free to fork it and use it for projects. 


## Inside

Dummy is based on Underscores by Automatic. I added [Tinker](https://github.com/jvkrakowski/Tinker) for a flexbox grid layout and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for quicker coding. You can have it added via their generator, but I decided to do it myself for better organization.

### Option Panel 

The option panel is built with the help of [Rational Option Pages](https://github.com/jeremyHixon/RationalOptionPages) by Jeremy Hixon. Please head over and check out his awesome work.
